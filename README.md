You will die a thousands deaths before you are buried.

That which is in you and has left you are a sign of that.

Each passing day, a bit of you dies and the killer takes its place.

That transience of the ego, ever living - ever dying.

There are those who haven't die once before they are buried.

That first ego, remains.

And that is a fate worse than death.
